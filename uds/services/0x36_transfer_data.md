# 📦 0x36: Transfer Data

**Purpose:** This is the "data pipeline" service. After initiating a download (0x34) or upload (0x35), you use 0x36 to actually transfer the data chunks. It's called repeatedly until all data is sent/received.

**When to Use:**
- Transferring flash/calibration data (after 0x34/0x35)
- Called in a loop for large files

## 🔧 Pro Tips

- **Block counter:** Starts at 1 (not 0), wraps at 0xFF
- **Max block size:** Determined by 0x34/0x35 response
- **Keep-alive:** Send 0x3E TesterPresent during long transfers
