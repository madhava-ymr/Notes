## 🍎 The Analogy
*Start with something everyone understands. No tech jargon yet.*

> **Imagine:** [The Concept] is like [The Analogy].
>
> *Example: "Public Key Cryptography is like a mailbox. Anyone can drop a letter in (encrypt with public key), but only you have the key to open it and read the mail (decrypt with private key)."*

---

## ⚙️ The Technical Reality
*Now map the analogy to the actual technology.*

| Analogy Element | Technical Component | Function |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Mailbox | Public Key | Encrypts data |
| Key | Private Key | Decrypts data |
| Letter | Payload | The actual data |
